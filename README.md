## ðŸŒŸ **Key Features**

1. **Addresses Rehabilitation Plateaus**  
   Patients often lose motivation after recovering gross motor functions. F.A.I.R. Chance provides **constant, measurable reinforcement** to continue fine motor recovery.
   
2. **Enhances Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)**  
   Fine motor skills are essential for writing, eating, dressing, etc. This tool directly contributes to **independent living** and **social reintegration**.

3. **AI-Assisted Personalized Therapy**  
   The application highlights which movements require more focus and tracks their progress, keeping the patient engaged even when a therapist is unavailable.

4. **Enables Remote Monitoring**  
   Healthcare professionals can analyze movement data and suggest improvements **remotely**, using the tracking insights gathered by the system.
